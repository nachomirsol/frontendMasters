# FUNDAMENTALS 1

## Big O

The way how we analyze how efficient algorithms, focusing to the important things that makes the result really consume big resources. For example Big O for 3x2 + x + 1 is (x2)

## Recursion

Recursion is when you define something in terms of itself, example of triangles made of triangles.
Functions that calls itself. Sometimes we use loops instead because of the footprint they have. Perfect for readeability
It is really important in recursion to know when to stop, if not you get stucked
